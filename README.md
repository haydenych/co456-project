# CO456 Project

## Instructions

```
python main.py {white / black}
```

## Techniques

- Minimax with alpha-beta pruning.

- Decrease search depth as it gets near the time allowance.

- Increase search depth on specific branches with limited moves (<= 2), this is because feasible moves are usually restricted to captures in anti-chess.
